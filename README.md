# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This web application was created to give me an online platform for all study notes on web developments topics like HTML,CSS, JavaScript and GIT. We addressed the problem of large amounts of online resouces on these topics being quite daunting and streamlining it into one web application to assist in the learning process. Through this project I gained insight into web application design and user experience.
